## SETUP

- Clone this repository to your local machine
- Run `npm install`
- Run `node seed`

## Challenge One - Angular Views and Directives

Switch to branch challenge-one

In this challenge, you will need to take the data for all the teas coming from the controller and arrange them in to a table in views/teas/index.html.

(You'll need to look inside the teas controller to see what is available to you in the view!)

Each tea has an image, price, ingredients, rating, availability, and a list of categories.

You will also need to have a search by name input box, and a search by category drop down list.

Finally, users should be able to select the quantity they desire from a drop down list and click an 'Add to Bag' button.

When the button is clicked, there should be a order items quantity that gets updated.

The completed challenge should look something like this:

!()[]

## Challenge Two - Teas Controller

Switch to branch challenge-two

In this challenge you'll need to create the teas controller.  You should not make any changes to the teas view.

When you're done, the teas view should be completely functional.
